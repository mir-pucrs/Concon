# Concon

Proposed timeline:

1. **15/02/2017**: Finish implementation of web front end - corpus collection start

	1. Plan (with Daniele) a strategy to broadcast and find users for the front end
	
2. **30/03/2017** Norm type identification using SyntaxNet and conflict detection approach

	1. **15/03/2017** Norm identification using syntax net
	
	2. **21/03/2017** Conflict detection using MLP
	
	3. **30/03/2017** Conflict detection using CNN
	
3. **30/04/2017** Sent2Vec + SyntaxNet for conflict detection approach

4. **30/05/2017** Retrain all models with data collected with the tool (integrate previous approaches to tool, IC will do this)

5. **30/06/2017** Thesis proposal 

6. **30/07/2017** Using the same web front, create a second function that allows people to test our approach online

	1. **15/07/2017** Create the front end to receive the application
	
	2. **21/07/2017** Connect the application (python) to the site
	
	3. **30/07/2017** Improve the tool visualization using diff properties

7. **30/08/2017** Write a paper to AAAI-18

8. **30/09/2017** Make experiments using other approaches over the new data, such as the CNN used in the AAMAS-2017 paper (try LSTM)

9. **30/10/2017** Compare all approaches, since the ruled-based one, using the labelled data

10. **30/11/2017** Use the comparison to generate a journal or a paper

11. **21/12/2017** If everything went wrong, start a new plan
